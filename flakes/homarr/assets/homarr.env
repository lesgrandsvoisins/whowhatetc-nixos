# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to \`.env\`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.

# The below secret is used to encrypt integration secrets in the database.

# This is how you can use the sqlite driver:
DB_DRIVER='@DB_DRIVER@'
DB_URL='@DB_URL@'

# Those are the two ways to use the mysql2 driver:
# 1. Using the URL format:
# DB_DRIVER='mysql2'
# DB_URL='mysql://user:password@host:port/database'
# 2. Using the connection options format:
# DB_DRIVER='mysql2'
# DB_HOST='localhost'
# DB_PORT='3306'
# DB_USER='username'
# DB_PASSWORD='password'
# DB_NAME='name-of-database'

# The following is an example on how to use the node-postgres driver:
# DB_DRIVER='node-postgres'
# DB_URL='postgres://user:password@host:port/database'

# The below path can be used to store trusted certificates, it is not required and can be left empty.
